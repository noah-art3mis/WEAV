# Wolfram Elementary Cellular Automaton Visualization (WEAV)

WEAV is a browser-based image generator. It creates a pattern using elementary cellular automata. Most of the patterns are boring but a few are noteworthy. It's an extremely simple algorithm (thus "elementary") that can generate organic-looking shapes that are not random.

Use it here: https://noah-art3mis.github.io/WEAV/

## Commands ##
### Enter
Run WEAV with same settings (for use with random ruleset and/or random start)  
### Arrow keys
Increase/decrease ruleset (scroll through to quickly see all the rulesets in order)  
### Tab
Hide control panel  

## Limitations
There is a command to save a screenshot, however Unity doesn't play nice with downloading things over the internet. For that, you might want to download the project. Also those are the only colors.
  
## Parameters
### Ruleset
Choose a specific ruleset or use one at random.
### Mode
Scrolls through the pattern or display a static pattern.
### Size
Render in either 19:6 format or square format, with variable resolution.  
### Start
Seed the algorithm with a single cell or with a randomly generated array of cells. Sometimes renders vastly different results.
