WEAV is a browser-based image generator. It creates a pattern using elementary cellular automata. 

Use it here: https://noah-art3mis.github.io/WEAV/

Most of the patterns generated by ECA are boring, but a few are noteworthy. It's an extremely simple algorithm (thus "elementary") that can generate organic-looking shapes. The star of the show is rule 30. There is also a turing-complete pattern.

## Input ##
#### Enter
Run WEAV with same settings. Use this with random rulesets and/or random start to generate many patterns quickly.
#### Arrow keys
Increase/decrease ruleset. Use this to scroll quickly through patterns.
#### Tab
Hide control panel. The corner panel cannot be removed. 

## Limitations
There is a command to save a screenshot, however Unity doesn't play nice with downloading things over the internet. For that, you might want to download the project. Also those are the only colors.
  
## Parameters
#### Ruleset
Choose a specific ruleset or use one at random.
#### Mode
Scrolls through the pattern or display a static pattern.
#### Size
Render in either 19:6 format or square format, with variable resolution.  
#### Start
Seed the algorithm with a single cell or with a randomly generated array of cells. Sometimes renders vastly different results.
