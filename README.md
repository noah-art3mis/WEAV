# Wolfram Elementary Cellular Automaton Visualization (WEAV)

WEAV is a browser-based image generator. It creates a pattern using the elementary automata algorithm and some other parameters. Play with the settings and explore the possibility space of elementary automata. 

Use it here: https://noah-art3mis.github.io/WEAV/

## Commands ##
  Enter: run WEAV with same settings (for use with random ruleset and/or random start)
  Arrow keys: increase/decrease ruleset (scroll through to quickly see all the rulesets in order)
  Tab: hide control panel
  There is a command to save a screenshot, however Unity doesn't play nice with downloading things over the internet. For that, you might want to download the project.
  
## Parameters ##
  Ruleset:
      Choose a specific ruleset or use one at random.
  Mode:
      Scrolls through the pattern or display a static pattern.
  Size: 
      Render in either 19:6 format or square format, with variable resolution.
  Start:
      Seed the algorithm with a single cell or with a randomly generated array of cells. Sometimes renders vastly different results.
