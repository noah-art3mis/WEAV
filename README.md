# Wolfram Elementary Cellular Automaton Visualization (WEAV)

WEAV is an image generator. Generate any elementary cellular automata pattern. Play with the settings and explore the possibility space of elementary automata.

Acess here: https://noah-art3mis.github.io/WEAV/

Parameters:
  Ruleset:
      Choose a specific ruleset or use one at random.
  Mode:
      Scrolls through the pattern or display a static pattern.
  Size: 
      Render in either 19:6 format or square format, with variable resolution.
  Start:
      Seed the algorithm with a single cell or with a randomly generated array of cells. Sometimes renders vastly different results.

Commands:
  Enter: run WEAV with same settings (for use with random ruleset and/or random start)
  Arrow keys: increase/decrease ruleset (scroll through all the rulesets and see them all!)
  Tab: hide control panel
